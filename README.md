## About

I wrote this a while ago, and it was originally intended as a learning project for C-Rust FFI, though it still works fine on all the systems I've tested it on.

## Built With

- Rust and C

### Note

- Only linux systems are supported.
- Anyone is more than welcome to contribute, even more so if you can improve the C code.
